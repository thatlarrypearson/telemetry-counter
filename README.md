# Telemetry System Boot and Application Startup Counter

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Updates the system boot count for use by other telemetry applications:

- [Telemetry OBD Logger](https://github.com/thatlarrypearson/telemetry-obd)
- [Telemetry GPS Location and Time Logger](https://github.com/thatlarrypearson/telemetry-gps)
- [Telemetry Weather Logger](https://github.com/thatlarrypearson/telemetry-wthr)
- [Telemetry IMU (inertial motion unit) Logger](https://github.com/thatlarrypearson/telemetry-imu)

## Usage

## Installation

## Common Library

### Goals

- Move configuration information (e.g. VIN based ```obd_logger``` files) and data generated by telemetry loggers out of source code directories.
- Mitigate file name issues when Raspberry Pi system clocks are unreliable.
- Improve traceability through the use of durable invariant data file naming conventions.
- Unique file names when using multiple vehicles with multiple data collection computers (requires computer names are unique and invariant as well).
